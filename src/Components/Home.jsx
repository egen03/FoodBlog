When you’re feeling down, what’s better than talking about it to your friends or family while eating some delicious food? Sharing food with a friend during times of trouble not only nourishes our bodies but also our souls. With food we make friends, court lovers, and count our blessings. The sharing of food has always been part of the human story!" />>
